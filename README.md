This is an attempt to implement a neuroevolution platform in Elixir based on the DXNN platform described and implemented in the [Handbook of Neuroevolution Through Erlang](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-4463-3) book.

The idea is to read the the book and translate the Erlang code in the book to Elixir chapter-by-chapter, improving only the variable names for better understanding and to prepare a ground for future refactoring.
